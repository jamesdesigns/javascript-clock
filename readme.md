# JavaScript Clock
This project is a JavaScript clock. I will continue building this project out by adding the numbers that count down with the live clock. 

## Installation
Type the following command in your terminal, and clone the project. 
```python
git clone https://github.com/jamesdesigns/javascript-clock
```
