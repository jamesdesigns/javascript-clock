# JavaScript Clock
This is a simple JavaScript clock. I will continue building this out by adding the numbers that count down with the live clock.

## Installation
Type the following command in your terminal, and clone this project. 
```python
git clone https://github.com/jamesdesigns/javascript-clock
```
